#### DISCLAIMER 1:
When opening larger Unity projects for the first time (especially if Unity has been configured and has cached files prior), it may give red errors describing object instances not being set correctly. These are not true errors, and can be fixed by either reloading the scene, deleting the ProjectSettings folder, deleting the Temp folder, going inside the Library folder and deleting anything with ShaderCache in the name, reloading the Unity project as a whole and restarting your computer. REMEMBER these are not true compilation errors! If Unity continues to give issues, contact davevad@umich.edu 
#### DISCLAIMER 2:
Unity Ads have been DISABLED on the repo because it requires a sign-in for the Google Play Store account attached to the build of the app. Therefore, Unity Ads will firectly give you 50 coins in the shared code, however, real builds of the apk DO have ads enabled, functioning and being tracked correctly.
